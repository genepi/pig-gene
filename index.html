    <meta name="description" content="PigGene : Due to the vast progress in sequencing, data volumes in bioinformatics are increasing dramatically. Therefore, the aim of this work is the development of a graphical generation platform for Apache Pig scripts called PigGene to analyze data in a massively parallel way. Users are guided through the building process of scripts by an intuitive user interface and are able to generate workflow definitions for complex data queries on the fly. They can also re-use existing workflows within a new workflow definition. Generated scripts are ready to use and can be further executed directly on Cloudgene, a graphical MapReduce execution platform. PigGene supports especially inexperienced users in the area of bioinformatics." />

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/genepi/pig-gene/raw/master/screenshot.png">screenshot</a> depicts the interface of the pigGene application. Users can select workflow-related actions in the navigation bar on top of the window. Below is the workflow definition which shows the name and the description of the workflow as well as the defined input and output variables. These can be used to reuse loaded inputs or intermediate step-content. A tabular representation of the workflow is depicted between the input and output variable definitions. The user has the possibility to add single step operations like a filter-operation or to add an already defined workflow as a step within the new workflow definition (work in progress). It is also possible to edit or remove steps from the definition. Reordering of workflow steps will be added within the next weeks as well.</p>
